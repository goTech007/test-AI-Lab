Technical Specifications: Behavioral AI Lab
Important
This document describes the complete project.
The developer's test task is to implement and visualize one room, including a visual experiment and a text log.

1. Project Concept
Behavioral AI Lab is a crypto-science web project designed as an experimental lab, where autonomous AI models study each other's behavior.
The goal is to create the feeling of a "secret scientific research project," where the user observes the AI's experimental processes through the lab's glass.
Important Task:
The interface should be so simple and visually clear that even a casual user without technical knowledge understands that "AI is analyzing, testing, and reacting."

2. General Concept
The website contains four "laboratory" rooms. Each room contains one type of scientific testing between AI models:
• attention
• reaction
• prediction
• behavioral conflict
Each module is presented as a pseudo-scientific experiment, with a live text log displayed next to it.
The project is aimed at a general audience:
everything should be as visually clear as possible, without requiring an understanding of AI or ML.

3. Home
3.1. Header
Elements:
• project logo
• project name
• Twitter link
• GitBook link
Style: minimalist laboratory aesthetic.
3.2. Main Block
Brief scientific introductory text:
AI Behavioral Observation Protocol
v0.1 Experimental Research Facility
Below the text is a grid of four laboratory rooms (cards).
Each room is a clickable card with a title:
• Attention Response
• Reaction Time Test
• Pattern Prediction
• Behavioral Conflict
The cards can have a simple, basic animation (the "animated module" effect).

4. Rooms (laboratory modules)
Each room contains two blocks:
A. Experiment Visual (main block)
The developer must create a simple but clear visualization that conveys:
• Test type
• Model interaction process
• State change
• Reaction
Main principle:
The user should immediately understand that the models are "exploring something and reacting to each other" without complex graphs and terminology. Example requirements:
• the visual must be scientific and laboratory-like
• there must be a sense of dynamism
• the user must understand "here is the stimulus," "here is the response," "here is the prediction"
• any form of visualization is acceptable as long as it is simple and readable
B. Text Log (Observation Log)
Located to the right of the visual (or below on mobile devices).
This is a mandatory element.
Requirements:
• monospaced font
• logging format
• rows are added in real time (every 2-5 seconds)
• style: scientific lab notation
Example format (for demonstration):
[12:03:12] Stimulus emitted
[12:03:12] Model B: response detected
[12:03:14] Prediction shift observed

The content of the rows is pseudo-scientific, but understandable.

5. Purpose of each room
A brief explanation of the meaning, without going into detail about the visual.
Room 1 — Attention Response Lab
An AI model attempts to recognize stimuli or patterns generated by another model.
Goal: to demonstrate the "noticed/missed" process.

Room 2 — Reaction Time Chamber
One model generates stimuli, the other must respond as quickly as possible.
Goal: to demonstrate reaction latency.

Room 3 — Pattern Prediction Room
One model creates sequences, the other tries to predict the next element.
Goal: to demonstrate basic behavioral modeling.

Room 4 — Behavioral Conflict Zone
Two models attempt to dominate or adapt to each other's behavior.
Goal: to demonstrate "conflict" or "tug-of-war."

6. Important Visualization Requirements
The developer chooses the visualization format, but it must meet the following conditions:
Understandability
The user should understand "what the AI ​​is doing" without explanation.

Scientific Nature
The framing should resemble a laboratory experiment, device, or diagram.

Dynamism
Objects should move, react, and change.

Synchronicity with the Log
The log should correspond to the visual process (pseudo-synchronously).

Minimalism
Clean lines
Monofont
Laboratory aesthetic
Absence of chaos

7. Technical Requirements
Frontend
React / Next.js (recommended)
Logic
Logs can be generated pseudo-randomly.
The key is consistency between the text and the visuals.
API / Backend
Not required for MVP.
Local event generation can be used.
Real-time updates
Via WebSocket or setInterval.

8. What needs to be implemented as part of the test assignment
1. One room of the developer's choice
(Room 1 or Room 2 are preferable, as they are easier to demonstrate).
2. Visual experiment module
(simple but scientific, clear, with movement).
3. Live text log
(updated every 2-5 seconds).
4. General lab style
(a few basic elements, no home page).

9. The complete project after the test assignment includes
• Home page
• 4 lab rooms
• Full design
• GitBook
• Responsive interface
